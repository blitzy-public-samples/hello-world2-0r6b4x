# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for learning React and TypeScript development, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of technical experience level, programming background, education, or development expertise.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive learning environment:

* Providing constructive code review feedback with explanations and learning resources
* Writing helpful documentation and comments that explain technical concepts
* Being respectful of differing approaches to React and TypeScript implementation
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism on code structure and patterns
* Focusing on what is best for the community's technical growth
* Showing empathy towards other developers, especially those learning React/TypeScript
* Providing helpful responses to technical questions with relevant examples
* Sharing knowledge about React best practices and TypeScript patterns

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Dismissive or hostile responses to questions about React concepts or TypeScript syntax
* Harassment or discrimination based on technical experience level
* Inappropriate or unconstructive comments in code reviews
* Public or private harassment related to programming ability
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments about code quality
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's programming background or experience
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional technical setting

## Our Responsibilities

that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

* Using an official project email address
* Posting via an official social media account
