# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements and specifications for developing a minimal "Hello World" web application. The document serves as a reference for developers, project stakeholders, and team members involved in the implementation and maintenance of the application.

## 1.2 Scope
The project encompasses the development of a simple web page that displays the text "Hello World" using modern web technologies. The application will:
- Utilize ReactJS with TypeScript as the primary development framework
- Render a single page with static content
- Demonstrate basic React component architecture
- Serve as a foundational template for future React-TypeScript projects

The project intentionally maintains minimal complexity to serve as a basic implementation example.

# 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

## 2.1 Product Perspective
The "Hello World" web application is a standalone, single-page application that operates independently without integration requirements to external systems. It serves as a minimal implementation of a React-TypeScript application within a modern web browser environment.

## 2.2 Product Functions
The application provides the following core functions:
- Renders a single React component displaying "Hello World" text
- Demonstrates TypeScript type safety in a React environment
- Serves static content through a web browser interface
- Maintains a component-based architecture following React principles

## 2.3 User Characteristics
The application targets two primary user groups:
1. Developers
   - Technical professionals learning React and TypeScript
   - Familiarity with web development concepts
   - Looking for reference implementation
2. Project Stakeholders
   - Technical and non-technical team members
   - Need to verify basic React-TypeScript setup
   - Require minimal working example

## 2.4 Constraints
- Technical Constraints
  - Must use React 18.x or higher
  - Must use TypeScript 4.x or higher
  - Must maintain browser compatibility with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Single-page application architecture only
- Development Constraints
  - Code must be strictly typed using TypeScript
  - No external UI libraries or frameworks beyond React
  - Must follow React best practices and conventions

## 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Assumptions:
- Users have access to modern web browsers
- Development environment supports React and TypeScript
- Basic knowledge of web technologies by development team

Dependencies:
- Node.js runtime environment
- React framework
- TypeScript compiler
- Web development tools (bundler, development server)
