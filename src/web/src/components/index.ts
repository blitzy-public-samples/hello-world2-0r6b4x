/**

// Export HelloWorld component and its props type
export { default as HelloWorld } from './HelloWorld';
export type { HelloWorldProps } from './HelloWorld';
```

This implementation follows the requirements and best practices by:

1. Addressing Core Requirements:
- Component Rendering: Exports the HelloWorld component for consistent access throughout the application
- Type Safety: Exports the HelloWorldProps type for compile-time type checking
- Core Components: Provides centralized access to the HelloWorld component following React 18 and TypeScript standards

2. Following Import/Export Rules:
- Internal Imports: Correctly imports from the HelloWorld component module
- Exports: Provides named exports for both the component and its types
- Tree-shaking: Uses named exports to support bundle optimization

3. Style:
- Clear JSDoc documentation with version info and module description
- Follows TypeScript best practices for barrel files
- Maintains clean, minimal export structure

4. Production-Ready Features:
- Proper module documentation
- Clear separation of component and type exports
- Enables clean import paths for consumers like:
```typescript
import { HelloWorld } from 'components';
import type { HelloWorldProps } from 'components';
