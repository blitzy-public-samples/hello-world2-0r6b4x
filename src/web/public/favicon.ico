File Format: ICO (image/x-icon)
Dimensions: Multi-resolution file containing both 16x16 and 32x32 pixel versions
File Size: Should be under 5KB after optimization
Colors: Simple "HW" monogram or letter design in black (#000000) on transparent background
Design: Minimal, clean design matching the Hello World application theme

The file should be created using an image editor that supports ICO format export with the following characteristics:

1. Format Details:
- ICO container with 2 embedded images
- 16x16 pixels (for browser tabs)
- 32x32 pixels (for bookmarks and larger displays)
- 32-bit color depth with alpha channel support
- Transparent background

2. Optimization Requirements:
- Compressed without quality loss
- Clean pixel alignment at small sizes
- Clear edges without anti-aliasing artifacts
- Proper alpha channel handling

3. Serving Configuration:
Content-Type: image/x-icon
Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800, immutable
ETag: Should be generated based on file content
Last-Modified: Set to file creation timestamp

4. Security Headers:
Content-Security-Policy: img-src 'self'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

Note: Since this is a binary file, it needs to be created using appropriate image editing software and exported in ICO format. The file should be placed directly in the src/web/public directory for proper serving by the development and production servers.
